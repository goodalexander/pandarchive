This project aims to solve a couple key problems:

1. Revisionist history. 

Too often data providers and investors like revising their data in a non auditable way. For example, credit card data vendors notoriously delete stocks from their coverage when their data does not successfully predict earnings. Tweeters delete tweets promoting stocks that collapse or shorts that get acquired. 

2. Ease of signal updates.

Many data driven investors have signals they'd like to sell to others, or publically disseminate. Right now, there is not standardized process for doing this.
